/*

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

*/

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]);

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  for(let i = 0; i < b.length ; i++){
      for(let j = 0; j < a.length; i++)
  }
}
